## The truly universal USB-C dream is finally realized for your Nintendo DS Lite!

Charge your Nintendo DS Lite with USB-C, using any USB-C cable and charger! If it fits, it'll charge! Finally you can stop carrying around that extra proprietary cable!

My design is inspired by [this existing PCB](https://oshpark.com/shared_projects/I6UOH6gb) that only works with ````USB-A -> USB-C```` cables. In my opinion, if you're gonna future-proof your DS, you shouldn't remain reliant on Type-A!

My PCB works with ````USB-C <-> USB-C```` cables as well, so you can use ANY USB-C cable/charger to charge it! I've also verified it works with ````USB-A -> USB-C```` cables, Quick Charge, and USB-PD! That means if your charger or USB battery pack offers 5V/9V/12V/etc., it will recognize the DS Lite can only accept 5V and charge accordingly.

# Compatibility

This is designed for installation in any Nintendo DS Lite (USG-001).

This is not compatible with the original (fat) Nintendo DS, NTR-001. ([My other mod for GBA-SP](https://github.com/rorosaurus/gba-sp-usb-c/), does work in the NTR-001.)

# Charge Speed

This console's original charger (USG-002) outputs up to 450mA at 5.2V. According to the USB-C spec, this mod will allow charging at up to 500mA at 5V. This mod will not result in any charging slowdown compared to the original charger.
