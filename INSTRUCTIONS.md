# nds-lite-usb-c
A USB-C port mod for the Nintendo DS Lite

# Instructions

## Step 1: Disassemble your Nintendo DS Lite and remove the motherboard

You can follow [this iFixit guide](https://www.ifixit.com/Guide/Nintendo+DS+Lite+Motherboard+Replacement/4784) for good disassembly instructions.

## Step 2: Remove the existing charge port

Use a solder-sucker, or solder wick to remove the solder from these 6 through-hole pins from the original charge port.

Take your time here, so you don't damage anything. Once you've removed most of the solder, the port should come off easily.

## Step 3: Prepare the new charge port

Assemble and test the new USB-C charge port!

Ensure that your USB-C PCB and the motherboard are flat and flush before continuing.

## Step 4: Position and attach the new charge port

The 5V half circle pad should line up just above the F1 fuse. You should be able to see the hole underneath it.

Verify the side lines up flush with your DS Lite's case, as desired.

The view from the bottom will show the VGND holes are just *slightly* not lined up with the USB-C port pins/holes. They are close enough, however - so when we bring them up to heat and add solder, a solid connection can be made. Verify that the VIN hole can see the 5V half circle pad from the top.

When you are confident with your positioning, I recommend soldering the 5V half circle pad to the VIN hole underneath. This makes it easy to tweak the position of the USB-C port, since the port itself won't be too hot to touch.

Once you've verified your positioning is perfectly in place, flip the motherboard over and heat the remaining VGND holes, flowing solder into those joints and ensuring a solid connection to the USB-C port above.

## Step 5: Case trimming

See how the current case fit is, and trim the case as necessary with a dremel, sandpaper, and flush cutters.

## Step 6: 3D Print bezel to fill the gap
